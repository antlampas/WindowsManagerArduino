A simple library to draw windows on TFT LCD with Arduino. This library relies on UTFT library by Henning Karlsen (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) and modified by Damian Golda (https://github.com/dgolda/UTFT) for the low-level communications between Arduino and the TFT LCD.
In theory, all the TFT LCD compatible with the UTFT library, are compatible with this library too.
