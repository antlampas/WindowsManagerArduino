#Arduino Windows and Windows Manager
##Abstract
A simple library to draw windows on TFT LCD with Arduino.
This library relies on UTFT library by Henning Karlsen (http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=51) and modified by Damian Golda (https://github.com/dgolda/UTFT) for the low-level communications between Arduino and the TFT LCD.
All the TFT LCD compatible with the UTFT library, should be compatible with this library too.
